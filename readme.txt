Get the most out of the Gutenberg Block Editor and build websites faster, easier, and intuitively with custom blocks.

== Description ==

Blockington is an addon plugin for the WordPress Gutenberg block editor that provides extra blocks and features, transforming the full site editing experience into a page builder capable of crafting websites faster, easier and cheaper. 

We are building on top of what Gutenberg block editor offers by introducing custom blocks that will help you build designs for pages or posts without the need for coding while providing a similar performance both in terms of page speed or SEO.

## Available blocks

### Accordion container [FREE]
Based on Bootstrap's accordion component, provides a container that groups inside accordion item blocks.

### Accordion item [FREE]
Based on Bootstrap's accordion component, provides a container for the blocks available inside an accordion component. The accordion item is a container for blocks.

### Alignment container [FREE]
Defines a flex container that can hold any type of block. It features all sorts of layout options such as justify-content, alignment, orientation, and gap.

### Responsive container [FREE]
Based on Bootstrap's container class, provides a container for the responsive row blocks.

### Responsive row [FREE]
Based on Bootstrap's row class, provides a container for the responsive column blocks. It also provides options for setting different gutter sizes for the Bootstrap 12-column responsive layout.

### Responsive column [FREE]
Based on Bootstrap's column class, provides a container for blocks. Its main feature is the ability to set the column size (over how many columns to span) and the offset value (how many columns to skip before displaying content). Being responsive, you can set different values for both columns and offsets depending on screen width, similar to what you can do with gutter sizes inside the responsive row.

### Web icon [FREE]
Choose a web icon from a collection of 1900+ icons (currently supports only Bootstrap Icons, more libraries will be supported in future updates) right from your block editor. Customize its appearance by changing various properties such as color, size, URL, alt, or target tags.

### WPForms Style Container - WPForms Integration [FREE]
This element is a container for an unlimited number of form blocks from the WPForms plugin. 

The WPForms styler addon features a wide range of adjustments such as font size, font weight, color, background color, padding, borders, or border radius. All these customization options can be used to style the form body, title, labels, input, and buttons.

Design your custom WPForms style once and add an unlimited number of WPForms blocks that will automatically inherit the style defined in the parent block.

Works with both free and paid versions of WPForms. More customization options will be available in the future.
